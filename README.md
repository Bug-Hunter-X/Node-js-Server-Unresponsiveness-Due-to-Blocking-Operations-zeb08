# Node.js Server Unresponsiveness Due to Blocking Operations

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js where blocking operations can cause the server to become unresponsive.  The `server.js` file contains code that simulates a long-running computation in the request handler, blocking the event loop and preventing other requests from being processed.

The solution, found in `serverSolution.js`, illustrates how to address this issue using asynchronous operations to prevent blocking the main thread and maintain responsiveness.

## Problem

Node.js is single-threaded, but it uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations.  When a long-running synchronous operation is performed within the request handler, the event loop is blocked. This prevents other requests from being processed, leading to a frozen or unresponsive server.

## Solution

The solution involves offloading the long-running task to another process or thread or leveraging asynchronous programming techniques such as using worker threads, Promises, async/await, or by performing I/O in a non-blocking manner.
